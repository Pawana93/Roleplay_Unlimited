Welcome to the Roleplay_Unlimited Project.


I started off as a young boy, who loved RPG's. I always wanted to make my own little game and share it with the world. Now the time is here.
I want to say: Who never dreamed of the own little game? I bet everyone did this at least once. Now it is time to do your best.

Because this little project is open to everyone, I want to keep it nice and simple. Please be nice if you state issues and consider, that the programmers offered their freetime to share a great project with you. 
That is the reason, why everything should be moderate.

What am I looking for?
That's easy. Roleplay_Unlimited is a steadily growing RPG Experience, that combines not only the best features. I want it to combine every feature. Be it PvP, be it Single Player or Multiplayer, even MMO can be possible.
Because that is pretty much for one person, I look for contributions in every kind. Be it editing of the Docs, Character Design in Blender for the game, your own, personal Monster, I take everything as long as it is Open Source.
If you want to know exactly what I want: Please look in the Issues under the "contribution work" label. Please also just contribute to the proper branches to minimize merging conflicts.

Please contribute to the following links for the matching Source 
Music: "Link follows"
Soundeffects: "Link follows"
Scenes/Sceneparts: "Link follows"
Characters: "Link follows"
Weapons: "Link follows"

I'm not looking for any kind of cash solutions or anything that leads to that. Roleplay_Unlimited should be open for everyone who wants to enjoy a little game or to use it as a base for something own.

This is my statement for now. 
If you find bugs or have suggestions, please use the issue tracker for that. 

So long
Pawana
