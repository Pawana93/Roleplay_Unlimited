# Roleplay_Unlimited
A selfmade 3D RPG, with OpenSource Code. Let's grow together

This 3D RPG is made by me to enhance my programming and design skills. I want the people to have fun with it and to grow with me. I want
so many features and I guess everyone has many ideas too. So I want everyone to take part in it, to make it a great game in the end.
So have fun. You get the first version soon.

The data is available for everyone. Don't be too shocked about it: It's all still a raw version. I want to update it really soon, so look forward to it
